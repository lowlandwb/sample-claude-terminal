The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth," covers over 5.5 million square kilometers across nine countries in South America, with Brazil holding approximately 60% of its total area. It is home to an estimated 10% of all species on Earth, including more than 40,000 plant species, 1,300 bird species, and 3,000 types of fish. The forest plays a critical role in regulating the global climate by absorbing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.

Despite its ecological importance, the Amazon faces severe threats from deforestation, largely driven by cattle ranching, soy farming, logging, and infrastructure development. Between 1978 and 2020, over 750,000 square kilometers of the Amazon were destroyed — an area larger than the state of Texas. Deforestation not only destroys habitats and drives species to extinction, but also releases stored carbon into the atmosphere, accelerating climate change.

Indigenous communities have lived in the Amazon for thousands of years and are among its most effective stewards. Studies show that lands managed by indigenous peoples have significantly lower rates of deforestation compared to unprotected areas. Conservation efforts increasingly recognize the importance of securing land rights for these communities as a key strategy for protecting the forest.

International cooperation, sustainable land-use policies, and consumer pressure on supply chains are all seen as essential tools for slowing deforestation. While some progress has been made — including a significant drop in Brazilian deforestation rates in the mid-2000s following policy reforms — the forest remains under threat, and scientists warn that continued destruction could push the Amazon toward a tipping point, transforming large portions into savanna and triggering irreversible changes to the global climate.
